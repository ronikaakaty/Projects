# Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Using Machine Learning  

This project utilized common cardiovascular disease risk factors to create a logistical regression model that aims to help predict the potential of a patient to get the disease. Being able to identify patients at risk early on can go a long way towards combating this disease and can increase the possibility of a positive outcome.
