# Airline Safety - Data Visualization

An example of how Data Visualization can be used in different ways to promote awareness. Due to myths in media and elsewhere, there have been fewer people flying than before. This project aims to show the audience that it has never been safer to fly using decades worth of data and backed by fact. The visualizations used change depending on the audience, however the message is clear that there is no safer way to travel than flying.
