This folder contains prominent case studies that have been completed and how I would have handled those situations. The Netflix case study example goes through various ways I would look to improve the Netflix recommendation algorithm and what factors I would consider if I were to create a similar model. The Target case study analysis example goes through Target's predictive model that was able to accurately anticipate when a patron was pregnant. I did a deep dive on this case study and walked through which factors I would consider and omit based on various considerations, including ethical.
